# Submissions
When someone fills out your form from the front-end of your website, their content is saved as a Submission. You can view Submissions in the control panel via Formie â†’ Submissions.

Submissions contain all the content a user has provided when filling out the form. You can also edit the submission in the control panel, should you wish to alter the content.

## Multi-page forms
For mutli-page forms, submissions are saved on every page submission. If the page is not the last page, the submission will be marked as `isIncompleted`. This allows you to see the content of incomplete submissions, which can be important for form abandonment. It also provides users of the form a means of saving their submission along the way.

You can view incomplete submissions in the control panel, but filtering the Submissions index.

## Spam
For submissions that have been classified as spam, the submission will not appear alongside other submissions. Instead, it will be categorized as spam. If you have chosen to opt to save spam submissions to the database (in your Formie Settings), you'll be able to filter submissions by their spam status, on the Submissions index.
