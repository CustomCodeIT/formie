## Captchas
Captchas are an important part of spam-protection for forms. Formie provides 4 captcha mechanisms, for further detail read the [Captcha](docs:integration/captchas) docs.

## Address Providers
Address Providers allow [Address](docs:feature-tour/fields#address) fields to use third-party services to autocomplete addresses. THis has a significant benefit of lowering user input errors for users filling out a form. Formie provides 3 address provider integrations, for further detail read the [Address Provider](docs:integration/address-providers) docs.

## Elements
Element integrations allow form submissions to populate other elements, upon form submission success. Formie provides this integration for the Entry element, for further detail read the [Element](docs:integrations/element-integrations) docs.
