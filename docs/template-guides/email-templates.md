# Email Templates
Email templates allow you to create custom templates for the emails that Formie sends out. These can be used similar to a "wrapper" around the content body of the email.

Let's take an example template:

```twig
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Thanks for your email</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1>Thanks for your email enquiry. The below email was sent from {{ siteName }}.</h1>

        {{ contentHtml }}
    </body>
</html>
```

Here, we've created a new template - let's call it `email.html`. Place this in the following path `templates/_emails/formie/email.html`.

Then, navigate to Formie → Settings → Email Templates and select "+ New Template". Give it an appropriate name, and enter `_emails/formie/email` in the "HTML Template" field.

You'll notice there's a "Copy Templates" field. You can use this to copy the default template into the provided folder to get off to an even quicker start to customise the template.

You may have noticed the use of a `contentHtml` variable in our templates - we'll cover that next. 

## Combining with Notification Content
You may have noticed the "Email Content" rich text field when editing an email notification. Here, you can provide content for all manner of things, including static rich text, variables and more.

As such, for this email template, you have access to a `contentHtml` variable. This is the HTML generated by the content provided in the "Email Content" field for the notification.

For our example, let's go ahead and edit a Notification for a form. If you haven't added one yet, go ahead and create a new one. For the "Email Content" field, use the variable select field (plus icon with a circle) and select "All Form Fields". This is a dynamic tag that outputs the content of all the fields' content. Much easier than having to loop through them!

Now, the email delivered will look something like this:

```
Subject: Thanks for your email

Body:

Thanks for your email enquiry. The below email was sent from Craft Test Site.

**First Name:**
Peter

**Last Name:**
Sherman

**Email**
psherman@wallaby.com

**Message**
Just wanted to say, I love the new website!
```

:::tip
Don't forget, Formie will automatically generate a plain-text version of your HTML emails.

# Custom Templates
In addition to providing a template for the overall email, you can customise the content for each field.
